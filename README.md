# I need service now.

## Epic
Create and application that will can provide users with the services that they need when they need them.  Providers can register their service as well as logon and modify their profile.
Registered providers will be vetted by the site and their Service will now be made available on the site until vetted.  Providers can logon and update their availability status or use Geo location to show themselves as 'green' or available for service.  Users will be able to search registered and vetted service providers having a listing of the service provider in order of their 'green' (available) status and geo location area.  When a user selects a 'green' status provider a SMS message will be sent to the user and the provider prompting both that a service has been requested.  Users will also have the ability to leave comments on service providers as well as rank the providers.  The goal of this site is to provide customers access to needed services 'now'.  An Admin console will also be implemented for the vetting of service providers and comment monitoring.

## User Stories
1. As a user I want to select from a listing of currently available services near my location.
2. As a user of a service I want an Text Messaging communication to start right away with between myself and the Service provider.
3. As a user I want to receive a SMS message that the provider has been contacted.
4. As a registered/vetted service provider I want to receive a SMS message as when a user is reaching out to me.
4. As a user I want to comment on the service quality provided by the selected provider.
5. As a user I want to be able to rank the service provider.
6. As an Administrator I want to be able to have edit control over the providers registered (so I can set the vetted boolean and delete those that do not pass the vetting process).
7. As an Administrator I want edit control over all comments.
